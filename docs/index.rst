Conch is an `SSH certificate`_ issuer which authenticates using OIDC access tokens.

It is intended to be used as a part of an interactive workflow where a real human is getting access to a system via SSH.

Flow
----

The general high-level flow for a client interating with Conch to get a signed certificate is:

.. mermaid::

      participant OIDC as OIDC issuer
      actor Client
      participant Conch

      Client->>OIDC: Authenticate
      OIDC->>Client: Access token (JWT)

      Client->>+Conch: /sign<br/>Passing the JWT
      Conch->>OIDC: Validate JWT
      note over Conch: Extract JWT claims and<br/>map to certificate principals

      Conch->>-Client: Signed certificate
